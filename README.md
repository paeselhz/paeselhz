### Hi there 👋

My name is Luis Henrique Zanandrea Paese, and I'm currently working as a Data Scientist at [Sicredi](https://www.sicredi.com.br/site/home).

Recently I've been migrating to a more MLOps approach to Data Science, helping others to automate their deploys and integrating it to technologies such as Terraform, Packer, Consul and Vault.

💬 Ask me about:
  - 🐳 Docker in Data Science Projects

  - :truck: Deployment of Data Science projects in multiple stacks
